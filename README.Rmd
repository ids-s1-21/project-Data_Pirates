## Summary

The data set that we decided to analyse for this project is called ‘Countries of the world’. The data set has a variety of information about different aspects of countries in the world between the year 1970 and the year 2017. It is made up of data from the US government specifically the CIA World Factbook. We decided to rename our variables using snake case in order make them more accessible to use and to evaluate.

Our main aim in this project was to research whether there is a relationship between various geographical, economic and societal qualities across the different countries. We hypothesized that there to be at least a weak relationship between quality of life and other qualities of the country such as economic and physical qualities. Therefore, we expected that our results would show at least some correlation between variables which would then in turn support our hypothesis. In this write up we will develop on the statistical techniques we used during the course of this project and whether or not we can conclude that our initial hypothesis is correct.  

The first thing we did was to answer our research question was to it break down into 3 components:
1. How strong is the correlation between economic and societal qualities?
2. How impactful are geographical qualities on the development of societal qualities?
3. What is the relationship between geographical qualities and economic qualities?

In order to answer the first component, we then decided to perform some linear regression in order to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and deathrate and infant mortality. We saw that the R^2 value was 0.432. This in turn showed us that there is a relatively positive relationship between GDP per capita and the death rate + the infant mortality rate. Hence, we can determine that there is a relatively strong between certain economic and societal qualities.

In order to answer the second component, we first wanted to show the relationship between GDP per Capita and service. Then we also wanted to show the relationship between the number of phones per 1000 people versus service. The output we generated as a result shows a clear positive relationship between each of the variables explored in the visualizations. To explore this even further we can calculate the r^2 value in order to see how strong this relationship is. 

In order to answer the third component, we wanted to show the difference in economic sectors depending on the continent. We used the agriculture, industry and service variable and saw that America had the highest value for service but the lowest value for agriculture. Meanwhile, Africa had the lowest value for service but the highest value for agriculture. There was also quite a significant difference between the continent which had the highest value for service (North America) and the continent which had the lowest value for service (Africa). This shows that there is a relationship between certain geographical qualities and economic sectors. 

In conclusion, we have used many types of visualisations in order to show the relationship between various geographical, economic, and societal qualities in our project. We can now therefore see the results directly and significantly. Firstly, there is a relatively strong relationship between certain economic and societal qualities which is shown by visualizing the GDP per capita and deathrate and infant mortality. Furthermore, we saw that there was a quite a strong relationship between geographical qualities and economic qualities which is shown by visualizing different economic sectors against continents. Finally, we saw how impactful geographical qualities are on the development of societal qualities and again we saw that there was a positive relationship between these two qualities. This was explored by visualising the relationship between the number of phones per 1000 people versus service and the relationship between GDP per Capita and service.

As a result of all this analysis we can now confirm that our hypothesis that was that there to be at least a weak relationship between quality of life and other qualities of the country such as economic and physical qualities is correct.
