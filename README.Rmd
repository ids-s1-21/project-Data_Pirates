## Summary

The data set that we decided to analyse for this project is called ‘Countries of the  world’. The data set has a variety of information about different aspects of countries in the world between the year 1970 and the year 2017. It is made up of data from the US government specifically the CIA World Factbook. We decided to rename our variables using snake_case in order to make them more accessible to use and to evaluate.

Our main aim in this project was to research whether there is a relationship between various geographical, economic and societal qualities across the different countries. We hypothesized that there to be at least a weak relationship between quality of life and other qualities of the country such as economic and physical qualities. Therefore we expected that our results would show at least some correlation between variables which would then in turn support our hypothesis. In this write up we will develop on the statistical techniques we used during the course of this project and whether or not we can conclude that our initial hypothesis is correct.  

The first thing we did was to answer our research question was to it break down into 3 components:
1. How strong is the correlation between economic and societal qualities?
2. How impactful are geographical qualities on the development of societal qualities?
3. What is the relationship between geographical qualities and economic qualities?

We then decided to perform some linear regression in order to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and deathrate + infant_mortality.  

We then wanted to show the difference in economic qualities (sectors) depending on the continent...

(add in description of other plots)

we also wanted to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and the proportion of crops being grown in comparison to the land avaliable to grow said crops...
