# extra

Any extra documents you might have go here. This might include Rmd files you're using to develop your project, any notes, or anything else. The contents of this folder will **not** be marked, it's just a convenient place to store documents and collaborate with teammates without cluttering the rest of your repo.

SECOND SLIDE:
QUESTION WE WANT TO ANSWER

THIRD SLIDE AND FOURTH SLIDE:
TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STATISTICAL METHODS WE USED AND WHY WE USED THEM. MAYBE ALSO ADD SOME MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

FIFTH SLIDE:
PART OF OUR CODE WHICH WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

SIXTH SLIDE:
3 OR 4 GRAPHS TO SHOW OUR OUTCOME

SEVENTH SLIDE:
TABLE FOR CERTAIN VARIABLES

EIGHTH SLIDE:
CONCLUSION WITH A PICTURE OF THE WORLD

WE HAD TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO DEAL WITH SPURIOUS RELATIONSHIPS

Plan Models
Which variables do we want to compare?

Population density 
infant mortality 


Coastline and GDP to see if there is a difference in the GDP per capita and if the country is bordered by the ocean
Trends in regions (whether certain regions have lower quality of life than others)
crops/arable compared to GDP. Arable is the percentage of land area where crops are suitable to grow and crops is the percent of land where crops are grown.
literacy & agriculture.

country with most population and compare certain variables with the country that has the lowest population

mean of some variable and compare different countries or regions.

 
line graph with geomsmooth


linear regression on most. 



How are do they help us to understand the differences between countries?








climate:

1) Dry tropical or tundra and ice, classification B and E.
2) Wet tropical, classification A.
3) Temperate humid subtropical and temperate continental, classification Cfa, Cwa, and D.
4) Dry hot summers and wet winters





# Using reveal.js

It's possible to have a horizontal sliding transition as well as nest multiple slides to create a vertical stack.

When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the top-level (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow.

(click the down key now)

## reveal.js

- The presentation is created using the `reveal.js` package

- You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the # and ## heading tags

- You can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (----)

----

- You can also add pauses between content on a slide using (". . .")

Like this.

...or using "::: fragment"

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

<div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">or text in two columns</div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">like this</div>
</div>

because you can combine HTML and Markdown syntax.

<p style="font-size: 8pt; position: absolute; bottom: -5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">*You can also add footnotes</p>





MAKE SURE WE DONT COMPARE VARIABLES THAT MAY HAVE A SPURIOUS RELATIONSHIP.....
